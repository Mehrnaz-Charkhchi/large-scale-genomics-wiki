## Refget: access to reference sequences

Refget is a specification to define a **standard way to access reference sequences** using an **identifier system derived from the sequence itself**. It is a fundamental building block of GA4GH providing a way for our standards to access sequences and to unambiguously identify them.

[To find more information please refer to the refget cave entrance](refget.md).
